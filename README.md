# CAFE STORE PRODUCTS CRUD

**This projects allows to:**
1. See all the products that have been created by the admin.
2. See the detail of every product.
3. If you are the admin, you can create, delete, and update products once you have logged in. 

**The *style* of the entire project comes from** Bootstrap and React Bootstrap. You can style things a different way, but the main point of this project is to make requests using *JSON Server* and to show live changes with *React Hooks* .

## Notes

In order to get *JSON Server* working, you have to execute the command *json-server --watch db.json --port 3004*. See the details in the *JSON Server* docs.

If you clone this project, rememeber to install dependencies!

The usersÂ´s register form layout is already done, feel free to develop the logic for that CRUD!
